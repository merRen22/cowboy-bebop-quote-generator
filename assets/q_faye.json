["You told me once to forget the past, cause it doesn’t matter, but you’re the one still tied to the past, Spike.","I can’t be stuck in one place for long—it’ll kill me. My whole family’s like that.","You know the first rule in combat? shoot them before they shoot you.","The past is the past and the future is the future. A man is a man and a woman is a woman. The present is the present. I am who I am and you are who you are. That’s all there is to it. Does it really matter? Or do we just think it does?","Survival of the fittest is the law of nature. We deceive or we are deceived. Thus, we flourish or perish. Nothing good ever happened to me when I trusted others. That is the lesson.","They often say that humans can’t live alone. But you can live pretty long by yourself. Instead of feeling alone in a group, it’s better to be alone in your solitude."]
