["I have no fear of death. It just means dreaming in silence. A dream that lasts for eternity.","Of the days that I have lived, only those I spent with you seemed real.","No one can draw a clear line between sane and insane. You move that line as you see fit for yourself. No one else can. You’ll understand soon… that the one that’s insane is this world.","Know much about purgatory? It’s the place between heaven and hell, where those who were left behind, unable to get into heaven continue to suffer, a place of struggle and pain. In other words, the world that we’re in now."]
